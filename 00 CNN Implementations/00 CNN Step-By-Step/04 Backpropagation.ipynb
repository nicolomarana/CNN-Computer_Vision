The backward pass for convolutional networks is complicated. If you wish, you can work through this optional portion of the notebook to get a sense of what backprop in a convolutional network looks like. \n","\n","When in an earlier course you implemented a simple (fully connected) neural network, you used backpropagation to compute the derivatives with respect to the cost to update the parameters.

Note that at each time, we multiply the the same filter $W_c$ by a different dZ when updating dA. We do so mainly because when computing the forward propagation, each filter is dotted and summed by a different a_slice. Therefore when computing the backprop for dA, we are just adding the gradients of all the a_slices. \n","\n","In code, inside the appropriate for-loops, this formula translates into:\n","```python\n","da_prev_pad[vert_start:vert_end, horiz_start:horiz_end, :] += W[:,:,:,c] * dZ[i, h, w, c]\n","```\n","\n","#### 1.2 - Computing dW:\n","This is the formula for computing $dW_c$ ($dW_c$ is the derivative of one filter) with respect to the loss:\n","\n","$$ dW_c  += \\sum _{h=0} ^{n_H} \\sum_{w=0} ^ {n_W} a_{slice} \\times dZ_{hw}  \\tag{2}$$\n","\n","Where $a_{slice}$ corresponds to the slice which was used to generate the activation $Z_{ij}$.

In average pooling, every element of the input window has equal influence on the output. So to implement backprop, you will now implement a helper function that reflects this.\n","\n","For example if we did average pooling in the forward pass using a 2x2 filter, then the mask you'll use for the backward pass will look like: \n","$$ dZ = 1 \\quad \\rightarrow  \\quad dZ =\\begin{bmatrix}\n","1/4 && 1/4 \\\\\n","1/4 && 1/4\n","\\end{bmatrix}\\tag{5}$$\n","\n","This implies that each position in the $dZ$ matrix contributes equally to output because in the forward pass, we took an average. \n","\n","**Exercise**: Implement the function below to equally distribute a value dz through a matrix of dimension shape.

If it is equal to 'average' you should use the `distribute_value()` function you implemented above to create a matrix of the same shape as `a_slice`.
