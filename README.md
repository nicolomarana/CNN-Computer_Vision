# Convolutional Neural Network and Computer Vision
This Repository contains my personal overview of the most important model and Techniques of Convolutional Neural Network and some projects on most important fields of Computer Vision.

## Convolutional Neural Network:
- Implementation (Step-by-Step, with TensorFlow, with Keras)
- Techniques (Pooling, Data Augmentation, Transfer Learning)
- Models-Structures (Le-Net 5, AlexNet, VGG, ResNet, Inception)

## Computer Vision Fields
- Image Classificaition
- Object Localization
- Object Detection
- Neural Style Transfer
- Face Recognition



----------------------------------
I create this repository studying books  and  take 2 Certificate about Convolutional Neural Networks on coursera.
